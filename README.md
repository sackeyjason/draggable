# Project: NOTES IN SPACE

Concept: freely place note cards in an infinite space.

Research into advanced forms of collaboration with hypertext, spatial organisation for notes, multi-dimensional text composition.

## Roadmap

- zooming user interface with all the niceties of, say, Google Maps:
  - pinch to zoom
  - scrollwheel to zoom (optional)
- full keyboard-driven UI too
- formatting and markup
- card links, multiple linked spaces
- storage, local and remote
- realtime subspace collaboration
- import, export

## Origins: Simple frameworkless dragging

Started as a plain JS and CSS UI experiment. What's the simplest way to get draggable elements? Uses custom variables.
